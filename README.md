**Programming Principles**
Every programmer benefits from understanding programming principles and design patterns. This overview is a reference for myself, and maybe it is of help to you during design, discussion, or review. The list is incomplete, and sometimes trade-offs need to be made between conflicting principles. However, higher ranked principles usually beat lower ranked ones.
The list was inspired by The Principles of Good Programming (down? Google's cache). I've added a bit more reasoning, details, and links to further resources. Let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement!
